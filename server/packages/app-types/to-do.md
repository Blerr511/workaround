# TODO app types

Need to implement shared type definitions package

It's should contain generated types and manually written type definitions for graphql backend

(optional) Try to make \*-api packages creation generic for easier setup for other services api packages

(future) Make up-to-date checker script that will check that generated api definitions matches what we have actually in graphql
